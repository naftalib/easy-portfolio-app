# easy-portfolio-app

This project was created using Creat-React-App. Please clone, npm install and use freely.

ABOUT

The programming logic for this app is in the 'projects.js' component located in the 'src' folder. The comments should explain everything.
To customise for personal use just change the data files (simpleProjects.js etc)in the utils folder by importing an image for your project like you will see I have done. Then add your unique details where applicable in the array values. In this app the array is being mapped over according to it's keys so any changes must be made only to the values. They will filter down via props to display the corect info according to your projects.

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

There is still need for improvement in this app. Please feel free to add.

1. Definitely needs to be restructured! BADLY! The file structure is terible and the App.js file is horendous. Lots of bad practices here, needs help!
2. Not yet fully responsive for mobile (in the porfolio section).
3. The data files are only mimicing JSON data from an API. Mabey there's a better eay to do this? Especially for uopdate simplicity.
4. Have an option for day/night theme.
5. Use a router to switch between the profile and porfolio so as to avoid the long scroll.
6. Revamp code to use functional components with hooks.
