ABOUT

The programming logic for this app is in the 'projects.js' component located in the 'src' folder. The comments should explain everything.
The crux of this app is a display pannel for your projects. The way I set it up is by creating data files containing an array holding an image of the project and some details about it, which are kept in the utils folder. This project data is being mapped over and returning a display component prototype which then conviniently displays each project found in the array, according to it's unique keys.
To customise for personal use just change the data files (simpleProjects.js etc)in the utils folder by importing an image for your project like you will see I have done. Then add your unique details where applicable in the array values. Don't forget to add all relevant links to live demos and GitHub.

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED - PLEASE HELP

There is still need for improvement in this app. Please feel free to help imrpove.

1. Definitely needs to be restructured! BADLY! The file structure is terible and the App.js file is horendous. Lots of bad practices here, needs help!
2. Not yet fully responsive for mobile (in the porfolio section).
3. The data files are only mimicing JSON data from an API. Mabey there's a better eay to do this? Especially for uopdate simplicity.
4. Have an option for day/night theme.
5. Use a router to switch between the profile and porfolio so as to avoid the long scroll.
6. Revamp code to use functional components with hooks.
