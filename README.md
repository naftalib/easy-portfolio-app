ABOUT                                             
The programming logic for this app is in the 'projects.js' component located in the 'src' folder. The comments should explain everything.
To customise for personal use just change the datA files (simpleProjects.js etc)in the utils folder by importing an image for your project like you will see I have done and adding your unique details where applicable in the array values. In this app the array is being mapped over according to it's keys so any changes must be made only to the values. They will filter down via props to display the corect info according to your projects.
